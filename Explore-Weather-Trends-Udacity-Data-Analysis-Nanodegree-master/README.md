## 		UDACITY Data Analysis Nanodegree Project 01: Exploring Weather Trends. 
## Summary
##### In this project, i analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends for the closest city from where i live which is 'Cairo' to overall global temperature trends.
###### The city i live in was not exist in the data so i used the closest city to my country .
##### The goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where i live.


## INTRODUCTION:
##### SQL Query was used to download (CSV) file that contains yearly average temperature of the City ‘Cairo’ and the global temperature. 
##### Then the data has been analyzed using Python Programming Language using IPython Notebook (Jupyter).
#####
## Progress outline: 
#### Extract the data : 
##### • Downloading 2 data files from SQL database as CSV.  
#### Create a line chart : 
##### • Calculating the Moving Average (Rolling Average) to make it easier to observe the trends when it be shown in Charts. 
##### • Visualizing the Data Using matplotlib
#### Make observations : 
##### • I made observations the i saw related to the data "you can find more details on the Report file"
##### • I made a conclusion about the data.

###### more details are existed in the Report file.
