# Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Introduction to Data Analysis

## Project: Investigate a Dataset

### Project Overview

This is the third project of Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity. In this project, we'll analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make our analysis easier.

### Why this project

In this project, we'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process ( like EDA, Data Wrangling and Data Story Telling ).

We'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

### What I learned

Some of the practices I learned from this project are:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

### Description

This data set is from the [list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTlVmknRRnfy_4eTrjw5hYGaiQim5ctr9naaRd4V9du2B5bxpd8FEH3KtDgp8qVekw7Cj1GLk1IXdZi/pub?embedded=True) of curated data sets provided by Udacity for this project.

I posed some questions in the starting of the project and then addressed those questions in my analysis.

I used Pandas, NumPy and matplotlib to generate statistical conclusion throughout my project.

Limitations of this data are also mentioned in the conclusion part.

### Metadata

It contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database(TMDb).

- Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
- There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. They are not important because this columns will not be included in our analysis.
- The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars accounting for inflation over time.

### Files

- Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb

This is the Jupyter Notebook where I perform the entire data analysis process.

- report.html

HTML export of above mentioned Jupyter Notebook.

- tmdb_movies.csv

This is the data which I used for this project.

### Libraries

You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- csv
